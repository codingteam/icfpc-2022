-- The larger the area, the cheaper it is to cut it into pieces. In limit, this
-- means we should always cut the *smallest* possible piece from the *largest*
-- possible area. The billboard solver is a simple implementation of this idea:
-- it cuts the image into vertical "stripes", and colours each one with an
-- average colour of its pixels.
--
-- As an optimization, adjacent stripes of the same colour are all filled in
-- one go, i.e. the solver skips the cutting step as long as the current column
-- has the same colour as the next one.
